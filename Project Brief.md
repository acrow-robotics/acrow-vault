## Empathise
With the rise of IoT (Internet of Things) devices, the world around us is becoming increasingly automated. This type of automation is most prevalent in indoor environments. Today, most of this automation is in the form of a large variety of highly specialised devices. This can present an issue in larger indoor areas, where it is simply impractical to install so many devices, especially when they are only used occasionally. What we need is an affordable, yet highly versatile IoT device that can traverse, navigate, and perform manipulation tasks in large indoor environments.

An example of a repetitive task that is experienced in human indoor environments is the task of ensuring that all the chairs are on desks. This is an example of a monitoring task which can be performed efficiently by one of our robots. An example of a manipulation task is opening and closing doors.

## Goal
We aim to build an affordable and versatile robot that can traverse, navigate, and perform manipulation tasks in any human indoor environment. To be successful in this task we must be able to traverse any obstacle which is ubiquitous in human environments. These obstacles can include stairs, elevators, tables, and chairs. We are focusing on large indoor environments such as schools, offices, and universities, as they are the most practical and useful places where our robot can be deployed. However, this does not mean that this robot cannot be deployed in smaller areas, which have a different set of problems that can also be solved by our robot.

## Requirements
#### Must Haves (Required/Mission Critical)
- [ ] To build a robot that:
- [ ] Can traverse a variety of obstacles that may be present in indoor environments
- [ ] Has sufficient force/torque to do so
	- [ ] Is reasonably small and lightweight
- [ ] Has an auxiliary slot to carry payloads or storage
- [ ] Has sensors to perform SLAM environment mapping
#### Wants (Desirable but not mission critical)
To build a robot that:
- [ ] Is very aesthetically pleasing
- [ ] Is easy to use
- [ ] Is useful in educational settings
- [ ] Is safe to operate alongside humans (as opposed to operating outside human waking hours)
## Limitations
### Time
We aim to have a mid-stage prototype ready by Illuminate 2023, and to have an MVP ready by Illuminate 2024.

### Cost
The robots **must** be possible to produce in under $1000 per unit. We are aiming to have the robot to be no greater than $500, so that it is possible to use in fleets, or in educational settings. This also allows us to compete with existing educational robots which cost thousands of dollars.

### Infrastructure
The school will likely not be able to meet our network infrastructure needs, so we need to be able to create a network topology such that it has little to no reliance on the school’s infrastructure.

### Manufacturing
We need to be able to produce most the robot’s custom designed components in-house, and that which cannot be produced using our equipment should be outsourced at a reasonable cost.
